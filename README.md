(for entertainment only)

### Overview

This application will take in the user's answers to a short, 10-question quiz, compare them to the current "friends", and will return the best match (the "friend" with the least cumulative difference between the individual answers).

### Instructions

1. The application is located as follows:

* Heroku deployment: [Friend Finder App](https://finding-friends-ftw.herokuapp.com/)

* GitHub repository: [Friend Finder GitHub Repository](https://github.com/bpzimmerman/Friend-Finder)

2. The Home page contains a link to the quiz, a link to the GitHub repository, and a link the will display a JSON formated object showing all the current friends.

3. In the quiz, all fields are required.

4. Once the quiz has been completely filled out, click `Submit` and the application will return the best match of the current friends.

5. Selecting `Done` in the modal will simply close the modal. Selecting `Redo?` in the modal will clear only the answers (leaving the name and photo information) and scroll back to the top of the page to allow you to refill the quiz answers.
